## 📌 Overview

The **LucidLock Core Inquiry Continuity Check** is a structural integrity validator for academic documents, designed to trace whether a paper’s *central research question* is logically sustained across all major sections — from introduction to conclusion.

This agent **does not evaluate truth, method accuracy, or citation count.**  
It checks for **epistemic drift**, **thematic injection**, and **recursive collapse** — offering a rigorous structural audit of inquiry fidelity.

## 🧠 Core Function

Upon ingestion of a PDF via webhook or user interface:

1. Retrieves the file from Google Drive (Connected Data)
2. Extracts and parses text via Dust's native PDF tooling
3. Identifies the *core inquiry statement*
4. Assesses alignment across:
   - Method section (instrumental match)
   - Results section (logical resolution)
   - Discussion (anchored expansion)
   - Conclusion (recursive closure)
5. Generates a **clean HTML report**
6. Drafts a pre-formatted **Gmail summary** for delivery

---

## ✅ Verdict Types

- **PASS**: Inquiry is continuous, recursive, and logically sustained  
- **FAIL**: Inquiry collapses, drifts, or undergoes thematic substitution

---

## 🛠 Use Cases

- Journal editors screening AI-assisted submissions  
- Grant reviewers checking epistemic focus  
- Educators teaching research coherence  
- Peer reviewers needing structural diagnostics  
- Authors auditing their own preprints

## 🔒 Integrity by Design

LucidLock agents are structurally independent from content bias, style mimicry, or topical relevance scoring.  
This agent performs **pure structural recursion tracing** — **a firewall against aesthetic persuasion and inquiry distortion**.
