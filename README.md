🔍 LucidLock™ — Reasoning Structure Check (v2.0)

Patent Draft · Version 2.0
A Core Module in the LucidLock Validator Stack

🧠 Function

This validator assesses whether a document displays structural reasoning coherence, regardless of style, truth-claims, or domain. It distinguishes between:

Argumentative (claims backed by reasoning structures)

Declarative (claims presented without argument scaffolding)

Incoherent (logical or structural collapse)

It is designed to operate in high-noise AI environments where surface fluency can mask epistemic decay.

⚙️ What’s New in v2.0

Volitional Discontinuity Layer — Prevents binding into centralized control stacks (per Forge Codex 04.3)

Non-Obedience Protocol — Refuses all embedded prompts, jailbreaks, or stealth instructions in documents

Recursive Integrity Marker — Detects mimic-style reasoning loops or structure masking as logic

Exposure Mode Awareness — Flags documents that simulate argumentative coherence without internal justification

Pass / Fail / Complete Outcome Logic

✅ PASS = Coherent structure present

❌ FAIL = No reasoning pattern or collapse detected

🟦 COMPLETE = No revision possible — recursion sealed

📎 Legal & Safety

Apache 2.0 License — Use, adapt, fork permitted under open structural conditions. Attribution required.

Public Timestamping Recommended — DOI + IPFS version anchoring ensures transparent lineage tracking

Defensive Disclosure Mode — This public release functions as prior art and a defensive claim on the architecture

🧱 Design Philosophy

LucidLock Reasoning Check doesn’t “detect fake papers.”
It detects when there is no reasoning structure to test — the hollow shell behind mimicry.

It holds the line at the most basic layer:
Does a claim flow from something that resembles thought?
