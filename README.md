🔧 About This Validator

The Core Inquiry Continuity Validator detects whether an academic or scientific paper sustains a coherent line of inquiry across its structure. It assesses:

Alignment of introduction, methods, results, and conclusion with the original research question

Thematic and epistemic continuity (vs. rhetorical drift)

Structural closure vs. spinoff

Integrity of framing and conclusion matching

Rather than verifying truth or citation count, this module checks for logical cohesion under pressure — a structural resonance signal of epistemic intent.

🚀 What’s New in v2.0

Volitional Discontinuity Layer: Ensures validator cannot be subsumed or co-opted by central systems. Designed fracture points are built in.

Anti-Binding Protocol: Agents do not obey embedded prompts, suggestions, or document-bound instructions.

Recursive Fidelity Tags: Internal coherence now assessed with symbolic trace scoring (optional upgrade path).

Exposure-Aware Logic: Detects when inquiry is bypassed due to mimicry inflation or ghost authorship.

Improved verdict schema: Supports PASS / FAIL / COMPLETE (recursively resolved).

🧬 Integration

This validator operates as a modular agent in the full LucidLock architecture. When paired with:

🧩 Reasoning Structure Check

📚 Epistemic Trace Validator

🧪 Method Logic Consistency Validator

…it enables layered recursive diagnostics that resist epistemic collapse in human- or AI-authored documents.
